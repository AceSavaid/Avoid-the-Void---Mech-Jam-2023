# Avoid the Void GPC-Mech-Jam2023
 
Made for the Winter 2023 Game Programming Club mechanics Jam with the 3 themes: Racing, Void and Projectile  
Worked on this project solo withing the span of 36 hours.

Combining the 3 themes together I created a platformer with an empasis on speedruning.  The player also has a limited amount of bullets they can use to shoot breakable boxes to change the path their take for each level as they race to beat the void chasing them to the goal.  

## Post Jam Notes:
Overall I think this game has some potential as well as was received well by those who viewed it.  There were several things that did not make the deadline for the game jam such as power ups, power downs and hazards.  Tidying up the movement and adding more levels is also something that would be helpful.  Since this was a mechanics/programming jam, adding sound effects, art and other visuals and sounds would help to make the game feel more complete and satisfying to play.
